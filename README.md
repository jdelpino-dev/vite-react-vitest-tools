# Vite React Vitest ESLint Prettier Template

This is a template for creating a React project with Vite, Vitest, ESLint, and Prettier.

Packages and commands are hadled with npm. I don't recommend using yarn with this template, because it is currently not working properly.

The following commands are available:

    ```bash
    npm install # Install dependencies

    npm dev # Start the Vite development server
    npm dev:lan # Start the Vite development server with LAN access
    npm lint # Lint the code with ESLint
    npm format:check # Check the code format with Prettier
    npm format:fix # Fix the code format with Prettier

    npm test # Run the vitests with no node warnings
    npm test:warn # Run the vitests with node warnings

    npm build # Build the project with Vite
    npm preview # Preview the build with Vite
    ```
